## Abstract

The Galaxy Training Network (GTN) offers a robust platform for bioinformatics training, complementing the ELIXIR Training Platform. With 34 topics, 464 tutorials, and 22 learning pathways, GTN provides comprehensive educational experiences, extending beyond Galaxy to include AI and programming languages.

GTN has achieved a perfect FAIRChecker score, showcasing its commitment to FAIR principles through automated infrastructure. The platform excels in participant engagement, with 3,000+ feedback responses aggregated automatically to enhance training effectiveness. Learning pathways, curated by experts, offer coherent and progressive learning experiences suitable for self-learning or training events.

Contributions to GTN are streamlined through Google Forms and automatic testing, allowing users without technical expertise to submit content, thereby increasing community participation. GTN recognizes contributors with detailed profiles and extends this recognition to projects, institutions, and funders. Community Pages provide real-time insights into growth and collaboration.

Event organization is enhanced with GTN Event Pages, offering tools like course handbooks and social media promotion, supporting both in-person and virtual events integrated with TeSS. GTN's Video Library 2.0 simplifies the submission of recordings, expanding multimedia resources.

The platform's focus on accessibility is evident from the uptake by communities such as hCNV, Single-Cell, RDM. Additionally, initiatives like the Galaxy Training Academy events attracted 10,000+ registrations and covering diverse topics. In summary, the Galaxy Training Network offers a technically advanced and user-friendly platform that complements the ELIXIR Training Platform and its Training Life Cycle. Its commitment to FAIR principles, community engagement, and innovative features makes it a valuable resource for the bioinformatics training community.
